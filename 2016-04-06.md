Personal notes by Graham Faulkner

## Keynote: Dr. Marc and Samantha Hurwitz: Leadership is half the story

- company is Flip Skills - [leadershipishalfthestory.com](http://leadershipishalfthestory.com)
- intro game with members of audience
  - two teams asked to self organize around a task, while playing hidden roles assigned by Marc and Samantha
  - group with one leader organized quicker and quieter, whereas group with multiple CEOs floundered
- Marc presented research re: leader and follower fish 
  - foraging most successful when in mixed leader/follower groups
- key points:
  1. you are only a leader when you are leading
  1. you are only leading when someone else is following 
  1. you are only a follower when you are following
  1. you are only following when someone else is leading
- leadership defined
  - building a frame for action (vision, mission, culture, strategy, intelligent constraints, reducing ambiguity) 
  - holding the frame (managing process, using good tools, minimizing biases and barriers)
- followership defined
  - creating within the frame (engaging, enhancing, executing, supporting, becoming informed)
- followership affects output quality, employee satisfaction and customer satisfaction
  - but not everyone knows how to follow -- needs to be developed
- followership is main reason for top talent and CEO/Executive derailment
- followership demands rise with rise in rank
  - i.e. team member requires mostly technical skills; senior exec requires more leadership, but also followership skills
- strong followership example - a helpful teen in home is given more privileges, praise and input into family decisions
- most training is around leadership rather than about followership even though we require both
- improving followership
  - offer explicit declaration of support to those in leadership roles
  - hold up a mirror, self-assess and make a plan
    - what are you doing to build/nurture the relationship with your leader(s)?
    - what are the additional things you could be doing to support your leader(s)?
    - how are you sharing accountability for being on your leaders's wavelength?
  - whenever there is a leadership action, think about what the complementary followership action is
    - i.e. need glasses (see through both lenses), not a monocle (see through one lens)
    - e.g. organization engagement requires leadership commitment, and team members engagement (virtuous cycle)
- what do you feel compelled to do with this new information?
- everyone has two roles: leadership and followership
- they also demonstrated an interesting way to brainstorm
  - each attendee wrote their name on back of their own sheet of paper, and then on the other side wrote down a question to ponder
  - they then wrote down a suggestion for how to address the problem/question at the top of the sheet
  - then they passed the sheet to another attendee, who could either build on the idea listed at the top of the sheet, or add a new idea to the bottom of the sheet
  - repeat passing the sheet to others as long as time permitted


## Keynote: Steven Page: Mental Wellness

- arts has tolerance for different points of view, but also allows unhealthy behaviour that would not be accepted elsewhere
- Steven wore taking antidepressants like a badge of honour - used it as excuse, rather than working on addressing things
- mental health diagnosis is based on questionnaire, not on medical test - inexact science
  - family doctors under burden to know enough about mental health, as well as the services and medicine available
- stigma starts from within - what others say is already being said to themselves by the sufferer
- during mid-30's Steven reached bottom and finally started psychotherapy (cognitive behavioural therapy - CBT) and drug counselling in earnest
- after particular low point that caught international media attention, he most appreciated visit by friends that didn't expect any explanations in return - just being there - the gift of presence
- the sooner you can identify and treat the problems, the better - rely on family and friends to know when you need help
- we each require mental health regime / habits - i.e. self care (sleep, eating, exercise, etc.)
- depression is different than sadness or melancholy - it is like a weight, an oppressiveness
  - feeds feeling of worthlessness and life being futile
 

## Salam Neighbor - Documentary screening

- film is about the Syrian refugee crisis and life in the Za'atari Refugee Camp in Jordan (80,000 refugees and growing)
- Chris Temple and Zach Ingrasci - from [www.livingonone.org](http://www.livingonone.org) - lived in camp for a month (had to sleep outside of campu in Mafraq for security reasons)
- most Syrian refugees in Jordan don't live in camps but rather in cities
- refugee camps run by UNHCR are under the laws of the host country i.e. Za'atari patrolled by Jordanian police
- 1.4M Syrian refugees in Jordan at time of filming (i.e. 25% of Jordanian population are Syrian refugees)
  - refugees not allowed to work in Jordan - Jordan has high unemployment rate
- on average, refugees spend 17 years in a UN camp
- Za'atari unique in the sense of a booming economy within the camp; operates more like a city than a camp; this happened only because UN relaxed some of the rules within the camp
- Za'atari short distance from ongoing conflict so can hear mortar fire, bombs, etc. constantly

## Salam Neighbor - Information session with Zach and Chris

- film sparked out of conversation with Salam Dalwasa (sp?), producer in LA who is daughter of Palestinian refugees
- took about 10 months to plan the trip
- the media reporting on Syrian refugee crisis was about conflict and extremism, and not the personal element and life in refugee camps 
  - Chris and Zach saw the disconnect and wanted to show this other side
- being in the camp put a face to the crisis - e.g. Ismail looks like Zach's dad
- need to get to know people before deciding what they need - e.g. wanted Raouf to go to school, without realizing that his school had been bombed and he was traumatized
- 85% of Syrian infrastructure is destroyed, so no home to return to
- three layers to the war (why it drags on)
  - Assad regime vs. various rebel groups, including radicalized groups such as ISIS
  - Saudi Arabia vs. Iran (for regional influence)
  - US/UK/west vs. Russia (proxy war)
- study of refugees in Uganda (who are allowed to work and move freely)
  - study showed that 25% of refugees in Kampala started own business, and 40% of employees were local Ugandans
- questions to ask:
  - What? i.e. what were my takeaways from the film?
  - So what? i.e. why is this personally applicable?
  - Now what? i.e. what will I do with the information I now have?
    - e.g. advocacy, fundraising, or volunteering
- how do we talk about refugees? 
- how can we foster dialogue, and not just monologue?
- people are afraid of what/who they don't know
- when you can talk about people you know rather than just the statistics, the crisis is less scary
- the best cure for guilt is action
- 1,100 Syrian refugees being resettled in Waterloo Region - lots of opportunities to help locally
  - e.g. welcoming refugees at the airport
- need to challenge our biases that are often reinforced by the media we consume
- the film is available on iTunes on April 14, 2016
