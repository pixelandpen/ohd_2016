# Organizational and Human Development (OHD) Conference 2016
University of Waterloo
April 7, 2016
Personal notes by Graham Faulkner

## Data driven: using Waterloo institutional data and research - Jay Athia and Jana Carson (from IAP)

- they have lots of enrolment data, especially for undergrads, but working on grad
- trying to use data to facilitate and evaluate strategic decisions
- major responsibilities:
  - institutional accountability
  - central data and indicator repository
  - institutional rankings and surveys
  - government reporting
- also working on:
  - policy development
  - institutional budget
  - enrolment planning
- UWaterloo has been working on an accountability framework (includes strategic plan, performance indicators, etc)
- types of data to evaluate:
  - operational measures - tracking day-to-day performance
    - e.g. IAP campus relations sharepoint site
  - accountability measures - progress measures (e.g. did people enjoy workshop they attended?)
    - Performance Indicators
    - public self-serve enrolment and degrees reports
  - strategic indicators - externally-focused, long-term 
    - e.g. Strategic Plan in Action - aligned with strategic themes; show strength/progress
- can get public IAP data via their websites or through special request
- scenario 1a - how many students registered in Geography in 2012 and are international students?
  - start at [uwaterloo.ca/iap](https://uwaterloo.ca/iap)
  - Then University Data and Statistics
  - Then Enrolment and Degrees
  - Then Student headcounts, and then filter to taste
  - Notes about the data: 
    - the data is a snapshot in time, based on government enrolment files
    - they use 'program grouping' versus a 'major' to accommodate cross-disciplinary discrepency
    - each indicator on the IAP site will have definitions, notes, data sources so you know where data comes from
- scenario 1b - how are the Geography students doing?
  - data stored in SharePoint (non-public) because it has some private data
  - go to University Data and Statistics, and then to Retention data
  - permanent residents are categorized under Canadian status
- scenario 2 - are our students satisfied? engaged?
  - can view student survey results available via IAP website - e.g. National Survey of Student Engagement (can view the survey instrument and the summary report provided by NSSE)
- IAP is charged with coordinating surveys across campus - ask them before performing your survey, as IAP might already be asking the questions
- scenario 3 - are our students employed? how does it compare with rest of Ontario?
  - IAP website, then Reports and MTCU KPIs for undergrad rates
  - the employment rates are based on a survey of alumni 2 years after they graduate
  - can also use Reports section's Co-op Education data to see co-op specific data
- scenario 4 - how does our department fare in international rankings?
  - IAP, select Rankings, and then QS
  - uwaterloo.ca/strategic-plan/in-action, and then select World Subject rankings
- Common University Data Ontario - [cudo.cou.on.ca](http://cudo.cou.on.ca)
  - e.g. can compare number of faculty at various schools


## Generation Z: R U Ready?

- presenters
  - Laura Gordon, National Marketing & Recruitment Specialist, Marketing & Undergraduate Recruitment
  - Siobhan Stables, Manager, Research, Marketing & Undergraduate Recruitment
- generation theory 
  - helps us interact and understand
  - era born shapes personality, etc.
  - overlaps produce a "cusp" effect
  - there are shorter generational spans
- some traits are cyclical - e.g. optimistic trait skipped Gen X but in Boomer and Millenials
- Gen X (and sometimes Boomers) are the parents of Gen Z
- Gen Z is a western cultural definition
- Gen Z:
  - loosely defined; born after 1995
  - oldest are 21 i.e. some are at university already
  - 2 billion world wide, and 25% of North American population
  - technology - mobile, cloud, always had Internet - focused on connectivity it gives them
  - uncertainty and change - Great Recession, global warming, aftermath of 911, rise in school shootings, increased racial diversity, shifting gender roles
  - raised by Gen X - praised individualism, prepare them to make own way, focus on being resilient, not being "special" (i.e. Gen X were latch key kids) - we are in the age of anxiety
  - tech is second nature - strong collaborators; empowered by information; networks are global; crave constant feedback; competing for attention
  - realists not dreamers - practical; pragmatic; financially conscious; research the real deal
  - socially minded - strong volunteerism; want to make a difference in world; environmentally conscious
  - family connection - more in common with parents; tighter connection; family is their support group
  - individualistic - value sense of identity; determined; competitive; still very collaborative
  - entrepreneurial - do not seek 9to5 jobs; focus on making things; turn hobbies into jobs
  - creative - spurred by fast information retrieval and innovation; more time to analyze and create solutions; self-directed and intrigued by paths of self-discovery; self-educated in a sense - YouTube rather than Google; value one-on-one time to get their own questions answered
  - new communicators - visual; shorter attention spans (6-12 seconds); bite-sized content, that is relevant; less formal style in their communication, but expect us to be professional; respond to content served in fun, creative way; drawn to incognito media and visual platforms
  - unique learners - faster CPU; multi-taskers; DIY and P2P learning; knowledgeable and mature attitude; susceptible to inaccurate source of information; value education and its rewards i.e. they are outcome-focused, especially regarding their career; education does not necessarily mean university - some find it too slow and will learn on their own
  - more focused on well-being / nutrition
- takeaways
  - communication - use images; make it searchable; more frequent, in shorter bursts; relevant; tell stories across multiple channels
  - engaging - draw in with innovative ideas; gamification; inspire with social causes; collaborate with them
  - interacting - be authentic; admit when do not know; avoid talking down (they think that all opinions are important and equally valid); embrace parents
- now we have "snow plow" parents rather than "helicopter parents"


## David C. Robertson - The LEGO Approach to Innovation: Innovating around the box

- @innonavi - Innovation Nagigation radio program
- @davidcrob
- author of "Brick by Brick", story of Lego almost going bankrupt in 2004, but then rebuilding and becoming stronger
- how we define innovation will affect how we manage for it and expect it
- SpinPop leads to SpinBrush toothbrush - valuable "try me" patent
- innovation different from creativity
- Sildenafil was an angina medication but turned into Viagra - new application of existing product
- innovation is a new match between a solution and a need that creates value
  - do not have to be inventions
  - can be incremental or radical
  - can be products, processes, models, services, etc.
- can create matrix comparing newness of need vs newness of solution
  - i.e. can enter a new market with old process (Egg McMuffin) vs. enter old market with new process (digital camera)
- when Lego returned to concentrating on existing markets with existing solutions it began to prosper again
- the genius of Lego is that it is a system of play
- the introduction of mini-figure was breakthrough - Lego started to scale sets around size of mini figures
- from 1978 to 1994 had tremendous growth, but plateaued starting in 1994
- to address plateau, they introduce more sets, which drove up costs and sent them into red; laid off 1,000 employees
- in 1998 Lego brought in turnaround expert - discovered Lego had lost touch with market
  - there are different methods of play e.g. video games
  - there are different ways to buy e.g. big box toys
  - most production by other competitors is in China 
  - Lego patents expired in 1980s so faced new competition e.g. Megablocks
- they tried to reinvent the future of play because they thought the basic brick had become passe
  - e.g. licensed someone else's story - Star Wars, Harry Potter - but didn't understand cyclical nature of demand i.e. demand peaked during movie release but product was stale in non-movie years
  - e.g. created TV show Galidor that was dismal failure
- what Lego learned from the 2003-2004 collapse
  - decreased number of distinct elements - do more with less (e.g. streamline variations on mini-figure faces and colour palettes); had to understand the difference between what is sufficient and necessary 
  - kids want to get involved in a story 
    - Bionicle showed this - it was the toy that saved Lego financially
    - Ninjago was another story-driven product line
    - Lego Movie ultimate extension of this story-driven production
- innovation is more like dating your customer, rather than fighting your competition
- Lego approach to innovation
  - Define what are the key products or services you want to sell? i.e. what are you NOT going to innovate?
  - Decide what is your business promise?
  - Design the necessary innovations
  - Deliver
- Disney and GoPro - they think about the total picture around their product
- Is your market changing? resist urge to reinvent education; can innovate around the core offerings and still do well 
- Lego partners with outsiders for video games rather than producing the games themselves


## Go further: Julie and Colin Angus

- at age 12, Colin read the book "Doug" about an around-the-world adventurer with little means
- eventually travelled for 5 years with friend around Australia, NZ, etc. - wrote travel books and documentaries
- Julie had background in molecular biology 
- recently did "Olive Odyssey" tour to track origins of olive tree
- first people to circle the world with human power
- used innovative risk management e.g. pitching tent in mining dump truck to reduce risk of bear attack in remote BC
- had to improvise with materials they had to meet needs - when trekking across Siberia needed backpacks, so make them from wood and cloth; listened to translator and accepted wisdom that changed course of entire trip
- tips to avoid "rowed" rage
  - maintain perspective
    - e.g. instead of being fixated on smaller details - e.g. almost run over by ocean freighter in Atlantic when both were down below trying to fix GPS and desalinator
  - celebrate successes - break goals down into smaller milestones
  - bring enough food
  - scheduled communication
    - address issues before they grow too big
  - don't look for things you don't want to see
- how to survive challenge - e.g. hurricane
  - be prepared - didn't expect hurricane, but made the Atlantic boat as sea worthy as possible before leaving Portugal for NA
  - deal with challenge head on 
  - learn from experience - e.g. created "helmets" from panty hose stuffed with clothes when facing their second hurricane
- you have to know when criticism is constructive - can use wrong criticism to motivate you to prove them wrong
- 43,000 KM in two years
- biggest takeaway for them was the power of baby steps - do the required hourly/daily activities, and the end goal can be achieved
